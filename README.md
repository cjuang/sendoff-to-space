# Sendoff to Space

Welcome to Sendoff to Space, a small website that informs visitors of the next launch to space and gives them the opportunity to write 
a small message to the spacecraft. All messages are posted on this site for everyone to view.

The backend of the website is coded in Python and SQL. The frontend uses HTML, CSS, and Jinja. Twitter Bootstrap was used for formatting.

# Vision
In 2015 alone, a total of 87 orbital rockets were launched worldwide into space. This number is likely to continue to grow in both 
the public and private sectors as it has been in the past several years as more countries enter the space market. On average there 
is something on a mission to exit the Earthâ€™s atmosphere roughly every four days. It's exciting that so many satellites/spacecrafts 
launch frequently; Sendoff to Space is designed to channel that excitement in a single location by giving people a platform to express
themselves directly* to the spacecrafts that are flying up.

*the spacecrafts will not actually receive the message, unless they visit this website

# Requirements
When running this website, the lxml and requests libraries are necessary. Use the following commands to install:
```
sudo pip3 install lxml
sudo pip3 install requests
```
# Running the Website in CS50 IDE

Change directories if necessary by running `cd final` in the command prompt.

After installing the required libraries, run `flask run` in the command prompt to view the Web Server.

See the SQL table of written notes from users by running `phpliteadmin messages.db` in the command prompt.

The website should be set-up and available for use. Try inputting a message by clicking the "Write a Message" tab in the menu bar. When 
you click on the "Send" button, the website will redirect you to the main page. Your new message will appear at the top of the table. 
The website automatically scrapes data from http://spaceflightnow.com/launch-schedule/ to give you the most current launch.



# Features to Implement in the Future to Strengthen the Website
Below are ideas that I would have liked to implement for this project, but did not due to time constraints. You can find some beginnings 
of code for these ideas commented-out throughout application.py and helpers.py.

- Maximum string lengths for the To, From, and Message form inputs
- Prevent the from from submitting if there is nothing entered in the form
- Delete messages older than 30 days from the SQL table
- Google newsfeed to alert visitors about current launch information
- Wikipedia summary of the launch
